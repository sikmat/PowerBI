# PowerBI
Building blocks of PowerBI
- **Semantic** - consists of all connected data, transformations, relationships, and calculations.
- **Vizualizations** - when you create a visualization (also called visual), you add it to the canvas for a report page

**Create a dashboard**
Dashboards consist of a single page made up of tiles. Add tiles to a dashboard by pinning a visual in a report to the dashboard. Tiles aren't interactive like visuals, so when a user interacts with the tile, they go to the underlying report for more information.

_To recap, the building blocks of Power BI are semantic models and visuals. Using Power BI Desktop, you create the semantic model and use visuals to create reports.

In the Power BI service, you can distribute content to your consumers and use reports to create dashboards._
